# Initializing /making a repository
*go ahead on your chosen location on your computer
*git init (mkdir, if you ls,nothing will show. But if ls -a, it'll show '.git')
*rm -rf .git(to delete repository)
##snapshot taking example
*git add file1 file2(send snapshot to staging area)
*git commit -m "(Initial commit-description)" (saving snapshot to repository,not
means staging area is empty,it still contains last items)
*lets say file2 is erased from the original, but still in staging area like what
we say b4. To remove, try git add file2. It'll see it has no file2 so its going
to remove it
