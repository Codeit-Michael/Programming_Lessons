*git config --global user.email michaelmaranan@gmail.com

*git config --global core.editor "code --wait" (means wait untill done)
*git config --global -e (open your current editor)
*git config --global core.autocrlf input (it only modify end lines when storing
codes to repositories)

*git config --help ,git config -h documentation

# Initializing /making a repository
*go ahead on your chosen location on your computer
*git init (mkdir, if you ls,nothing will show. But if ls -a, it'll show '.git')
*rm -rf .git(to delete repository)
##snapshot taking example
*git add file1 file2(send snapshot to staging area)
*git commit -m "(Initial commit-description)" (saving snapshot to repository,not
means staging area is empty,it still contains last items)
*lets say file2 is erased from the original, but still in staging area like what
we say b4. To remove, try git add file2. It'll see it has no file2 so its going
to remove it

# Staging files
*git status (show activities, if files == red: they are not in staging area)
*ADDING - git add {file/s: file1 file2,*txt/(any file type), or . means evrtg}
--if you run git status again, you'll see added files turns to green means they're
in the staging area

-if we modify an added file again via:echo world >> file1.txt, it is diff on what
we push, so to update just repeat the git add file1.txt

# Committing changes
*git commit -m "{description}." or just git commit - (directs you to edit them better)
*then save it and as if you go back at the terminal it shows your commit process

# Committing practices
-when? for bug fix or for typo
-Why/what is it all about? make it descriptive(HINT: you can use its present/
past tense like fix and fixed)

# Skipping the stage area
*git add -a -m/-am "{Description}" -the -a means append everything

# Removing files
-lets say you delet the file2.txt, but its copy is still in staging area (see it
in git ls-files)
*to remove it there,git add file2.txt
*then declare it to the commit area by: git commit -m "deleted unusuals"
*1 operation removal git rm file/s,*type,.

# Renaming or moving files
*git mv file1.txt file1.js, then commit it : git commit -m "{dsc}"

# Ignoring files (for private logs if you're in a team)
*mkdir .gitignore, next pass your personal dir or what
*then git add the .gitignore and commit it
*git rm --cached -r {file} (for removing only at the git folder, not in whole
place) then commit it

# Short status
*git status -s
--red means not saved,?? means not in staging area

# Viewing staged and unstaged changes
*git diff --staged
