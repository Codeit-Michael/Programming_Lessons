1. Git clone from the git repository you need to push to. Just make sure you 
  create a new directory for the cloned code.

2. Copy the contents of the cloned repository into the local directory that has 
  your current code. Make sure to copy the .git (hidden) file.

3. cd into your local directory and run "git remote -v". You should see the 
  remote repository git address.

4. "git add -A" or "git add ." to add whatever change you require and commit it.

5. Finally "git push"
