What is Django?
-is a python fullstack framework for making websites

-some Django features
* Admin site
* Object Relational Mapper (ORM)
* Authentication
* Caching 

-Using python manage.py runserver will give you django server(Python lightweight
server so you don't need to problem Apache while under development). Use this
server only while your app is under development. If you want to change IP adress
just do the ff: python manage.py runserver {4 digit chosen IP adress}

-Difference of Project and App
A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. An
app is does the work. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in
multiple projects.

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
-How the web works
* URL(Uniform Resource Locator)- after clicking it, it sends an http request
(hypertext transfer protocol request) to the server. As a response, the server
sends you a http response (maybe html and/or data).

--ADDITIONAL(install pipenv to prevent file crash; makes a virtual environment)

#~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

# Different parts of django project
*Outside the project package folder
- manage.py - lets you interact with your project package. Lets say your package
project interacts with your django app.

* Inside the project package folder
-__init__.py: empty file that tells Python that this directory should be
considered a Python package
-settings.py: Settings/configuration for this Django project
-urls.py: The URL declarations for this Django project; a “table of contents” of
your Django-powered site
-asgi.py: Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface-compatible web servers to serve
your project
-wsgi.py: WebSGI-compatible web servers to serve your project

### Making projects and apps are in making-django-projs.txt ###


# Using Django apps
-views.py - must return templates. Need to be map it to URLs using URLConf in
separate file. Make a urls.py inside the app folder where you put URL for views.

-Next add the ff in django project/urls.py: 
from django.urls import path,include

urlpatterns = [
    path('{chosen url; maybe name}/', include('{app name}.urls')),
]
