## Part 1: Installing
1. Making a project- choose a dir then type "django-admin startproject
{project name.let's use (mysite)}"

2. Making an app- python3 manage.py startapp {name. lets use (polls)}.

adittional: (Making a simple message 'hello world')
1. Go to polls/views.py and type:
from django.http import HttpResponse

def func1(request):
    return HttpResponse('hello world')

2. Make a file urls.py at polls and type:
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('helloworld/',views.func1)
]

3. In mysite/urls.py, follow the ff. for URLConf/URL Configuration

## Part 2: Database setting up, creating first model, and a quick intro to
Djangoâ€™s automatically-generated admin site
1. Database Setup
- Head to the mysite/settings.py and as you notice it is full of module-level
stuffs. 

1.1 Database dictionary- Django has installed database already which is SQLite.
But you can change your db if you want, other db like mySQL, oracle, etc.
As if you notice the DATABASE dict, it contains 2 items:
* ENGINE (depends what backend and db you are using)
* NAME (contains full path (including filename). The default val contains 
BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3' will store that file in project dir)

1.2 Set the TIME_ZONE on your timezone

1.3 INSTALLED_APPS- it has all the app names. It has default apps which is
listed because of the common cases.

1.4 Migrating- to migrate, type 'python3 manage.py migrate'. It creates a 
necessary db tables based on apps present at INSTALLED_APPS and writes
them in your backend/db.
