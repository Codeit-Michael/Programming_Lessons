What is Heroku
- A PAAS (Platform as a service) where you can deploy your apps or projects to
cloud.

How to use:
-Let's say you already has an account. Tap at the upper right corner the "create
new" then put the name of your app.

 Creating new git repo
  -Install the heroku terminal interface by following the link, just click the
  "Heroku CLI" and follow the instructions. ex: curl {link} in terminal

  -On terminal, run "heroku login" then log in

  -Head to the directory of your and if you haven't git, 'git init'

  -next type heroku git: remote -a entryapp

 Deploying your app
  -git add . and git commit -am "message" for gits
  -git push heroku master

Deploying Django app: actions in terminal
1.Login First - heroku login

2.Prepare the app
 git clone https://github.com/heroku/python-getting-started.git 
 cd python-getting-started 

3. Deploy the app
 -Create app: heroku create
 -Deploy: git push heroku main
 -The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app
  is running:heroku ps: scale web=1
 -you can open the website as follows: heroku open

4. Scale the app
 -check how many dynos: heroku ps
 -Scaling an application on Heroku is equivalent to changing the number of dynos
  that are running. Scale the number of web dynos to zero: heroku ps:scale web=0
 -Scaling it up again: heroku ps:scale web=1

5. Declare app depencies
 -The requirements.txt file lists the app dependencies together. When an app is
  deployed, Heroku reads this file and installs the appropriate Python dependencies
  using the pip install -r command. To do this locally, you can run the ff.
  command: pip3 install -r requirements.txt
