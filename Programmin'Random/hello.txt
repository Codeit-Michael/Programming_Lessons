OAuth (authorization)
-limited permission for the apps that needs access on a specific file, info on your google account.
-Once an app is trying to access some of your files &/or info, google will asks you about this. If you recognize them, google will give this app a limited token for what it is just asking for so everytime it needs access on your files &/or info it just hand its permission token instead of asking you again.
