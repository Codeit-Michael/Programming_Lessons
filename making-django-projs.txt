# Making django projects
1. Select or create a directory. EX: "storefront" folder
2. Type "pipenv install django" to make a virtual environment. You can see
the location at virtualenv location. EX: Virtualenv location: /home/michael/.local/share/virtualenvs/storefront-SZgUppvg
3. Head to the directory and type "pipenv shell" to activate the virtualenv.
4. Type "django-admin startproject {dir name}" to start a new project. But
it creates multiple directory. Instead lets use "django admin {dir name} ."
so it uses the current dir. Use "django-admin" only to see the commands.
5. A file called manage.py nxt to your project is its the wrapper. You can run
it through that file.EX: "python manage.py runserver" gives you a URL/Link that
connects you to your project.
