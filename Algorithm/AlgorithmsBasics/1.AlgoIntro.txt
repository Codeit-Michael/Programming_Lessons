Software creating
-Designing Phase
-Implementation Phase
-Design your software first before you solve it

algorithms
-the design phase 
-domain knowledge
-what does your code
-problem analyzing(how does it flow)

programming
-implementation phase
-prgraming language
-hardware and software (pick what os and hardware type is it for)
-Testing(Debugging)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Algorithm characteristics
1. Input -what/how much data does it takes
2. Output -atleast 1 result
3. Definiteness -how accurate is it
4. Finiteness -stops when it reach its limitation
5. Effectiveness -it must perform each algorithm step correctly in a finite time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Analyzing Algorithms
1. Time complexity -how long does it takes
2. Space complexity -how much space does it takes
3. Network Consumption -how much data is transferred
4. Power -how much power is it consuming
5. CPU registers -how much CPU register it does
