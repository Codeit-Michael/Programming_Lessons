5 branches of Git

Feature branch
  A branch were you make one or more feature one by one. You can make another
  branch under this and for each feature you make and when your done at that 
  feature, you can merge it in your feature branch. The next branches will be 
  processed by the software admin or anyone that got those job.

Develop branch 
  Your features from feature branch will be tested in theis branch.

Release branch 
  After the feature satisfies the requirements in Develop branch, it will be 
  merged in Release branch where it will be tested in other cases. If it passed 
  the tests, then it will be merged in Master branch.

Master branch
  The place where main software was in.

Hotfix branch
  Branch for quick fixes of bugs that found on master branch even the code is 
  working. In this case, the software won't go back on other lower testing 
  branches because it is in main already, means it passed the test before.
