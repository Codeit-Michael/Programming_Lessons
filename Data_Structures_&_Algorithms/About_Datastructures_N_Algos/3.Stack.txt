"The Stack"

Data Structure Types

random access data structures vs. sequential access data structures

Random access- access independently by index. Provides O(1) unlike sequential
ex: using book to get the info you only need
Random access ex: arrays, arraylist

Sequential access- access in order.
ex: tape measure. To access the 50 inches, you must past first the 1-49 inch
sequential access ex: stacks, queues, linkedLists


Stacks methods
-Last in, First out (LIFO principle)

Methods of stacks
Push()
-enter elements bottom to top

Pop()
-remove elements top to bottom

Peek()
-return elements at the top

Contains()
-searching w/o modifying anything
-allows searching in process of taking objects as args then return a booleans
-Contains(Object) Outout: True or False (Booleans)


Time Complexity Equation

Accessing -O(n)
-ex: we had a stack of rocks and we need to get the bottom rock,
-for every rock we need to remove or to pop (which is the datasets), we need an action for each rock(or the opt required)

Searching O(n)
-same as accessing

Insert & delete O(1)
-can be done in one process

Ex: 
-Stacks are like recursion(calling self repeatedly)
-Undo/Redo
-Back paging
