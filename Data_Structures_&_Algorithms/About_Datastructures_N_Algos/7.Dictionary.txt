"Dictionaries"
-also called Maps or Associative Arrays
-absract data structure that has keys n value pairs 
-keys used to access their values by calling them
-just like the real world dicts. The first 3 letters are the keys and 
may lead you to their value


hash table- used to build a dict

hash function- how the dict make a key for a specific content using indexes

hash collision- when u want to put 2 diff. keys on the same index
-to solve this we use open /close addressing

Open Addressing- putting each of them to the nxt available index

Close Addressing- It uses linkedlists to chain 2 keys together which results 
on to same value
- these method can be used if we want to add multiple key on a single value pair


Time Complexity Equation
Accessing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting = O(n)

Ave. Time Complexity Equation (Normal use)
Accessing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting = O(1)

why Dicts are very useful data structure
-has an option for non-numerical indexes- in accessing values
-flexibility on making keys- keys maybe str,nums,etc
-its speed bcoz it is using hash table implementation
