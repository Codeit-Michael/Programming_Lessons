"Queue"
-also a subsequential access data structure
-opposite of stack which has rules of FIFO (First in, First out)

Ex: First in first out
-instead of top & bottom at stacks, it has tail,mid n head
-newer are on tails

*Stack (queues are just like stacks)
	-Push	-Pop	-Peek	-Contains

Queue methods
	-Enqueue = Enqueue(Object)

	-Dequeue- empty: Dequeue(), it removes the 1st to last

	-Peek- to access ascending

	-Contains = Contain(Object) - to search

Time Complexity equation

Accessing & Searching O(n)
-like the stack, it access files/ contents in linear
-ex: you need the tail, so you need to dequeue all in its front


Insert & Delete O(1)
- just like the stack


Queue example:
-Job scheduling
