"Arrays/Lists"
-most common data structure 

3 array attributes
1. Name- array's name
2. Type- str, int, float, etc.
3. Size- cannot be changed unless rewrite

ways in setting an array:
~Put it's attributes while making the code
~Put attributes inside it as the code goes by 

-access arrays using index

-2d lists/2d arrays- array/s inside array

BIg O NOtation in Arrays

Accessing O(1)- Constant
-printing the array w/ the index of chosen content

Searching O(n)- Linear
-because most part, we're working w/ unsorted arrays

Inserting & Deleting O(n)- Linear
-in inserting, we need to shift contents to the right then append at the index
-the same as deleting

Pros:
-can store similar contents
-easy to understand, access and write

Cons:
-unchangeable size of array
-low efficiency in inserting & deleting
-use too much storage space

arraylist- can grow;appendable

variability for ArrayList
add method	set/change method	get method
remove method	clear method		toarray method- convert aryLi - li


Arrays vs. Arraylist

Arrays- good for small projects
-fixed size	-stores any data types
-methods need to create		-smaller memory based on arraylist

Arraylist- for interactive codes/ programs
-Dynamic size	-stores objects only
-methods already created	-larger memory based on array
